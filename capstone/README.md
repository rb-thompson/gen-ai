# AI Research Assistant Capstone Project 

For this project, I am tasked with building an intelligent research assistant that can automatically search, analyze, categorize, and synthesize information from research papers and articles.  

**Requirements**:  
- **Automatically categorize** thousands of research papers by domain.
- **Intelligently process** and clean messy text data from various sources.  
- **Extract key insights** and summaries from complex academic documents.  
- **Provide natural language interfaces** for users to interact with research data.  
- **Operating autonomously** to conduct research workflows without human intervention. 

**Structure**:
