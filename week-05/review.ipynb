    "\n",
    "A **neural network** is a computational model designed to process and learn from data, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron processes input data by applying weights, biases, and non-linear activation function to produce an output. The network learns by adjusting these weights through a process called backpropagation, minimizing the error between predicted and actual outputs."
