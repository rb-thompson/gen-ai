# Fundamentals of AI
Hi! This GitHub repository is for my **Fundamentals of AI** class projects. This repository contains weekly projects and exercises completed as part of a 2025 AI course taken during my coding meetup. Each project corresponds to a week in the class schedule, exploring core AI concepts through hands-on coding.


## Repo Overview
This repo is organized into folders, each representing a week of the class (e.g., `Week_01`, `Week_02`, etc.).  

Inside each folder, you'll find the project code, datasets (if applicable), and a brief description of the work done.  

The projects build on the concepts covered in the weekly schedule below, starting from Python to advanced topics like deep learning and generative AI.

## Run It
To run the projects:  
- Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Fundamentals-of-AI-Class-Projects.git
    ```

- Navigate to the desired week's folder (e.g., `cd week_02`).

- Install dependencies (if any) listed in the folder's `README.md`. Most projects require:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
    
- Run the project code (e.g., `python project_code.py` or open a `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook).

## Contributing
This repo is primarily for my personal class projects, but feel free to explore the code and provide feedback! If youâ€™re part of the coding meetup, feel free to fork it, submit changes, or just collaborate.
