I am currently at the midterm of a Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) bootcamp, with 10 weeks remaining until project submission. The objective of this course is to equip participants for careers in data science through the completion of an AI capstone project. The field of machine learning and artificial intelligence is multifaceted, encompassing various roles across diverse domains. **I'll tell you, it's wilder than yard onions.**

**GOAL**: Complete the homework and capstone project, demonstrating strong proficiency in coding practices and project delivery.  

**TIMELINE**: July 21, 2025 â€“ September 18, 2025  

**RESOURCES**:
- Preparatory Coursework
- Pandas Mastery
- Modeling Techniques
- Data Challenge - Kidney Disease Prediction  

**PLAN:**  
1. Gather prerequisites, files, and instructions from GitHub.
2. Begin exercises while exploring potential project ideas.
3. Initiate project creation concurrently with exercise completion.
4. Refine past projects while outlining capstone steps.
5. Review exercises and past projects, noting key insights.
6. Incorporate insights and complete the capstone with peer review.  

**LAST WORDS BEFORE DIVING INTO THE UNKNOWN**:  
*Well, I love stories and I love pizza so data science and pie charts were an easy path to go down.*
