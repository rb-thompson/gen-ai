QuantumLabs Analysis Report
==============================
To: Lead Engineer, QuantumLabs
Subject: Plasma Control Optimization for Fusion Reactors

Analysis:
- Dataset: 50 experiments across 4 reactor types.
- Linear regression predicts energy output from magnetic field strength.
- Model performance:
  - R-squared: 0.99 (explains 99% of output variance).
  - RMSE: 4.46 MW (average prediction error).
  - Cross-validated MSE: 22.40 MW² (robust fit).
- Slope: 19.85 MW per tesla, indicating strong control impact.

Recommendation:
- A 7.5 tesla setting is predicted to yield 159.62 MW.
- Optimize ProtoStar-1 reactors, which show high output efficiency.
